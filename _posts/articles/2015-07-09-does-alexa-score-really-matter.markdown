Growing up my mom always said I was special. One in a million. Admittedly, little Mini-Me felt pretty great about myself. 

Six years later, I would hear her tell my brother the same thing. But I was skeptically ok with it, since *this time* she was obviously lying.

Fast forward to present day. 

- World population: ~7.125 billion
- U.S. population: ~318.9 million

Do I still think I’m special? Hell yeah. But I don’t think I’m one in a million anymore, because that would mean there are 7,125 out there just like me. 

That brings up the question: Would I ever rank myself against all that exist globally? Or within the U.S. for that matter? Would you?

I think I’m special. (And hopefully those close to me do too.) But to the rest of the world, I’m just another guy who doesn’t matter. 

I could, however, rank people in my life pretty well – my family, friends, co-workers, random people I know, and ex-girlfriends. (In case you’re wondering where you stand, that’s my real ranking system.)

If you’re a website owner, you’ve probably heard of [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/)[^1] and know your Alexa rank, be it global or within your country. Since you probably don’t own Google, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu, or Walmart, chances are you aren’t too happy with your ranking. 


Many a times I’ve been asked the question: What is wrong with my website? How do I f@$\*ing improve my Alexa ranking? Why does that sh\*ttier looking website have a better Alexa ranking than my ‘not so sh\*tty’ looking website?  I’m paraphrasing, of course. 

It was during a SuccessLab meetup when - Michelle DeSpain, a friend, client, author and a web celebrity [The Late Bloomer Revolution](http://www.thelatebloomerrevolition.com) brought up a concern about her Alexa ranking, which was fairly good by any standards. Unlike you, Michelle’s pretty high up in my personal ranking system, I gave her a tl;dr version of all that I am going to talk about here.

##What the fuck is Alexa?

Unless you’ve spent the past two decades as a castaway on a deserted island and are still dealing with the realities of losing Wilson, you probably already know what you need to know about what Alexa is and what it does. And, in case you are that person, as soon as you’re done reading this, go check out “Gangnam style on YouTube”. You have a lot to catch up on.

Alexa, Actionable Analytics for the Web, is a subsidiary of Amazon.com. It provides website rankings based on the information collected by its Alexa toolbar. A higher Alexa ranking simply means that your website has more traffic regardless of site and traffic quality. Alexa doesn’t judge your subject matter, and it doesn’t judge your referral sources (good or bad). 

###How the fuck do I find my Alexa Ranking? 

This post is actually me telling you not to give a crap about your Alexa ranking, but if you really are hell-bent on finding out about it, punch in your good ‘ol URL here and you’ll be on your way to superficial glory or infamy.

##Why the fuck you should ignore Alexa Score/Ranking?

Alexa Score and ranking is only based on the people who have the Alexa toolbar installed. Depending on the computer literacy and interest in rankings of your target audience, this leaves a huge loophole in the traffic your website actually gets compared to the traffic Alexa says your website gets. So, unless you’re comparing your Alexa ranking with someone who’s almost directly in the same niche and caters to the same demographic as you, you’re comparing apples to oranges, where apples win hands down.
Your website’s Search Engine Results Page (SERP) ranking relies on a lot more complex data than just the traffic. It relies on how well your website is optimized, how valuable the search engines think your content is in relation to what your target audience is searching for, whether or not your website is mobile friendly, how well you’ve structured your content, etc. If you did some blackhat SEO, bought tons of backlinks and somehow increased traffic to your website, your Alexa ranking might jump up because you’ve arbitrarily increased your traffic. Of course, you might get blacklisted by Google because you cheated.
Alexa has no way of tracking mobile traffic. Judging by the number of “dumb” flip phones still in use, it’s safe to say mobile makes up for a considerable chunk of any total traffic on any website – no matter your niche and target audience.

Now, for the past few years, Alexa has started presenting a bit more information other than just your rankings based on traffic. They now give you daily page visitors, daily page views, time spent by visitors on your website, search keywords that send traffic to your website, etc. But, all that probably sounds familiar to you if you’ve ever heard of Google Analytics, which does all that and much more. The biggest difference? All this new data by Alexa is still dependent on their toolbar, so it’s not accurate. 

Furthermore, if you have Alexa toolbar installed and if you spend a considerable amount of time on your own website, you’ve already skewed the data collected by Alexa, particularly your daily pageviews per visitor and daily time on site. If you’re concerned about the same issue in your Google Analytics account, it in fact provides you with a way to exclude internal traffic so it can collect and present only relevant data. This is something Alexa doesn’t, and can’t, do.

###So, who the fuck actually cares about Alexa ranking?

Website marketers (or owners) – who use it to inflate or deflate their egos. Hey, there’s nothing wrong with that, just as long as you don’t use that metric to actually define and plan your marketing strategies. I, too, sometimes while pitching myself for a project like to boast about how my mom thinks I’m the best web-developer in the world. 

Affiliate Marketers – who feel better associating with websites that get more traffic. This strategy is still not half bad, especially if they tie in this metric with others to judge whether or not their affiliate source caters to their niche. 

Domain acquisition companies and professionals – who use Alexa rankings among other things to consider what your domain is worth. But, if you’re not planning on selling your website (or company) then you should not care what they think of your website. 

##The Fucking Verdict
The subset of human (hopefully) species who are likely to install the Alexa toolbar skews towards a certain demographic. If your target audience doesn’t completely overlap with the same demographic, you are more likely to have a lower Alexa ranking. 

My point here is simple. 

>*Ignore a metric that means little to nothing, outside of inflating or deflating your ego.*

<div class="tldr">
<div class="tldr-title">TL;DR</div>

	<li>Alexa Score and ranking is skewed.</li>
	<li>Don't use it foryour marketing strategies</li>

If you still care about improving your Alexa rank, start by tricking your entire demographic into [installing the toolbar](http://www.alexa.com/toolbar).
